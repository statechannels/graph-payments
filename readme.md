# StateChannels / The Graph

In this repository, you will find three main components and some testing infrastructure:

## `@graphprotocol/statechannels-contracts`

Contains the "Attestation App", the State Channels app that services payments.
Payments made by the gateway are _conditional_ on the indexer correctly signing an attestation.

## `@graphprotocol/payments`

Contains two main components,

1. `ChannelManager`: Used to manage the creation and closing of AttestationApp channels
2. `PaymentManager`: Used to create "payments" and submit "receipts" in "running" AttestationApp channels

## `@graphprotocol/receipts`

Contains one component, the `ReceiptManager`. This component serves two purposes:

1. Inputs state channel messages into the wallet that were generated by the `ChannelManager`
2. Creates "receipts" for payments.
